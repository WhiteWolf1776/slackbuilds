WhiteWolf1776 SlackBuilds
=========================

These are my personal slackbuilds.  Some are taken from slackware source, some
from slackbuilds.org, and modified as needed to support the latest versions of
the applications.

These are all tested with the latest slackware64-current published.

Package Notes:
--------------
xine-lib / xine-ui
  - Likely abandoned by slackware soon and have not been updated in some time
  - these custom builds will go against the latest ffmpeg, etc, giving xine
    what it needs to function properly.

ffmpeg
  - Needed for xine to run properly.
  - SBO version rather outdated for latest xine and other apps.

qemu
  - SBO has fallen rather behind so here's one that builds latest qemu release.
