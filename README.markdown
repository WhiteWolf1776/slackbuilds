WhiteWolf1776 SlackBuilds
=========================

Note : major rewrite in progress. Flapak + slackware 64 (not multilib) will be the focus ongoing.

These are my personal slackbuilds.  Some are taken from slackware source, some
from slackbuilds.org, and modified as needed to support the latest versions of
the applications.

These are all tested with the latest slackware64-current published.

The generate_pkg_build script will check for the latest version and create a slackbuild folder ready to create the pkg and install
